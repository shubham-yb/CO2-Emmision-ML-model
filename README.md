Significantly reducing CO2 emissions from cars will not be easy, but the available data can 
be used to extract the features, know the behaviour of cars, and try to reduce the emissions. 
Machine Learning techniques can be used in this regard.
This project is based on a Kaggle dataset. Objective of the project is to predict the amount 
of carbon dioxide emitting from different cars using supervised learning techniques 
(specifically regression is used here). Regression is a widely used learning algorithm which 
helps in predicting continuous numerical outputs
